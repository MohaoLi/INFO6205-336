Problem Description:
We try to create a genetic algorithm to solve the travelling salesman problem. Hypothetically, given a set of cities that have different co-ordinates (x, y), the constantdeparture and the destination cities is same city but not in the cities set, we try to find the shortest path for a route that begins from the departure city, visits each city once in the cities set and returns to the departure city.
